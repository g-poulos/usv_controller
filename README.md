# USV controller

This repository is dedicated to the vereniki platform model used in 
[usv_simulation](https://github.com/g-poulos/usv_simulation). It contains 
an open-loop and a proportional controller and the simulation of the platform 
dynamic model. 

## Control

### Source the ROS installation

```
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/usv_controller
source ../../install/local_setup.bash
```

### Open-loop Controller 

Using the kinematics of the platform its movement can be controlled by defining 
a 3x1 vector: $q_c = [f_x, f_y, n_z]$

## Dynamic Model Simulation

## Simulation results comparison
